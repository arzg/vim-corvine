## Installation

Use your favorite runtimepath/plugin manager, or place `corvine.vim` into
`~/.vim/colors/` for \*nix and `%userprofile%\vimfiles\colors\` for Windows.

## Usage

If you’re using a GUI, then Corvine should work out of the box. However, if you’re planning to use Corvine in a terminal, the terminal must support the 256 colour palette, which most modern ones do. If you want other terminal output to match with Corvine, then set its colours to match the ones below:

| Colour     | Normal    | Bright    |
| ---        | ---       | ---       |
| Black      | `#3a3a3a` | `#626262` |
| Red        | `#d78787` | `#ffafaf` |
| Green      | `#87af5f` | `#afd787` |
| Yellow     | `#d7d7af` | `#d7d787` |
| Blue       | `#87afd7` | `#87d7ff` |
| Magenta    | `#afafd7` | `#d7afd7` |
| Cyan       | `#87d7d7` | `#5fd7d7` |
| White      | `#c6c6c6` | `#eeeeee` |
| Foreground | `#c6c6c6` |           |
| Background | `#262626` |           |

A preset with these colours is included for iTerm.
